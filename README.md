# Obsidian URL Display

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin can extract external URLs from the active note and display them in the pane.

![demo](https://github.com/lin-stephanie/obsidian-url-display/blob/main/docs/demo.png)
## Features

- Extract external URLs in the active note and show them in the pane.
- Customize the content displayed in the pane through [plugin setting](#settings). 
- Left-click to navigate to the location of the URL in the active note.
- Middle-click (or click the navigation icon for special case) to open the URL in a new browser tab.
## Usage

### Install

- Directly install from Obsidian Market, or:
- Download the latest release. Extract and put 3 files (main.js,  styles.css, manifest.json) to folder {{obsidian_vault}}/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-url-display.

### Enable

- Move focus into a note, then:
- Select on the plugin icon in the ribbon, or:
- Open the command palette and select the command `URL Display: Open or close pane`.

### Update URL list

- Keep focus in a note, then:
- Right select on the plugin icon in the sidebar and select `Refresh list`, or:
- Open the command palette and select the command `URL Display: Refresh list`.

### Tips

- Normally, when you switch between different notes, the URL List will be automatically updated.
- After you modify URL in the active note, you need to manually refresh the URL list as mentioned above.
- Note that the plugin also extract URLs in code, code block, callout and document property.
- In Live Preview mode, the location reminder for the URL in callout is not obvious enough.

## Details

### Supported URL formats

```md
https://example.org
[Alias](https://example.org)
[](https://example.org)
```

### REST API used

If you enable `Show favicon` or disable `Use alias` in the plugin settings, the plugin will use the free [MicroLink API](https://microlink.io) (`https://api.microlink.io?url=`) to request URL metadata, but there is a limitation: 50 requests/day. Don't worry, the plugin will cache the metadata to avoid repeated requests of same URLs.

Note that it takes a certain amount of time to request URL metadata (depending on the number of URLs in the note). **If you want to display the URL list as soon as possible, it is recommended that disable `Show favicon` and enable `Use alias`.**

### About cache mode

If you want the favicon to appear faste, you may choose `memory cache`, but please note that it may affect the current performance. If you don't care about speed and there are many URLs, it is recommended to choose `disk cache`.

## Todos

- Optionally exclude URLs in code, code blocks, and document properties.
- Add global search and copy features.
- Support extracting URLs from other plugin views (such as Kanban).
- Add external URLs to note footer as footlinks.
- URL list can be downloaded as netscape bookmark file format.
